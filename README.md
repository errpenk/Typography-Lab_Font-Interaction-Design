# Typography Lab Project

This project is a minimalist experiment in dynamic typography. The same input text can be rendered in two completely different visual systems depending on whether the characters are lowercase or uppercase.

## ✦ Concept

**Typography Lab Project** is a digital type specimen that functions as a dual-state application. It explores two distinct visual identities:

1.  **LOWERCASE (Schematic Mode):** Dark themed, architectural, SVG-path based.
2.  **UPPERCASE (Industrial Mode):** Light themed, bold, the variation of Chakra Petch (bold/debt).

The project demonstrates how to manage complex state transitions and high-performance DOM manipulation using modern, vanilla JavaScript architecture.

##  Key Features

*   **Dual-State Engine:** Seamless switching between "Schematic" (SVG) and "Industrial" (variation) modes using a centralized State Manager.
*   **Event-Driven Communication:** Decoupled interaction between the Grid and the Diagram overlays using a custom Event Emitter pattern.
*   **Data-Driven Rendering:** Typographic data (SVG paths) is separated from logic, allowing for easy updates to the glyph set.
*   **Reactive Playground:** A typewriter input that dynamically renders the custom glyphs based on the current state.



##  Engineering Highlights

This project is built with a focus on modern engineering principles for maintainability and scalability:

### 1. Decoupled Components via Event Bus
Components communicate asynchronously using a custom `EventEmitter` (Pub/Sub pattern). This ensures that the `GridSystem` (which handles user interaction on the alphabet) does not need direct knowledge of the `DiagramOverlay` (which visually responds to hovers).


### 2. Config over Code
The extensive SVG path data for the custom alphabet (GLYPHS_LOWER) is critical but inherently separate from application logic. By moving this data into src/config/typography.js, we achieve:

*   **Readability:** Logic files are cleaner and easier to understand.
*   **Maintainability:** Typographic assets can be updated or replaced without altering core application logic.
*   **Reusability:** Data is more portable.

### 3. CSS Variable Theming
The dual-state application (lowercase vs. uppercase) is managed efficiently using CSS Custom Properties (Variables). JavaScript's role is minimal: it simply toggles a class on the <body> element. The SCSS then uses these variables to dynamically apply themes.


## Design System
The visual language and typographic foundation are meticulously crafted and defined in src/styles/abstract/_variables.scss.

*   **Font A (Schematic/Code):** Courier New - Used for the input field and character counter, evoking a sense of technical documentation.
*   **Font B (Industrial/Header):** Chakra Petch (imported via Google Fonts) - Provides a bold, impactful display for headers and key elements in uppercase mode.
*   **Font C (UI/Labeling):** Helvetica Neue (fallback) - Offers a clean, standard sans-serif for general UI elements and labels in uppercase mode.
*   **Accent Color:** #00d2ff (Cyber Cyan-based) - A vibrant, consistent accent used across both themes for interactive elements and visual highlights.
